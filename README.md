error_event | when an error occurs during the checkout process | myCheckout.setCallback("error_event",myErrorEvent);
payment_receipt | when transaction is complete and receipt is ready to be collected. | myCheckout.setCallback("payment_receipt",myPaymentReceipt);
payment_complete | called once Moneris Checkout has completed payment. | myCheckout.setCallback("payment_complete",myPaymentComplete);
page_closed | called when user is on payment page and try to <ul><li>Close window</li><li>Click on Browser Back Button</li><li>JavaScript error occurred from Moneris Script</li></ul> | myCheckout.setCallback("page_closed",myPageClosed);
